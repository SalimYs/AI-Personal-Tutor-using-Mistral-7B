# Future Applications with Hugging Face

This document outlines potential enhancements and projects you can undertake using the Hugging Face ecosystem to expand your AI-powered personal tutor.

---

## 1. Model Fine-Tuning

* **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** Implement LoRA, Adapters, or Prefix Tuning to adapt Mistral 7B to your domain with minimal GPU resources.
* **Full Fine-Tuning:** Use `transformers.Trainer` or `accelerate` to fine-tune on custom datasets (e.g., educational dialogues, Q\&A pairs).
* **Dataset Preparation:** Create and preprocess datasets using the Hugging Face Datasets library (tokenization, splitting, filtering).

---

## 2. Evaluation and Monitoring

* **Evaluation Pipelines:** Define evaluation scripts leveraging `datasets` metrics (e.g., perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE).
* **Experiment Tracking:** Integrate with Weights & Biases or TensorBoard for tracking training/validation metrics.
* **Model Cards:** Write comprehensive model cards to document fine-tuning datasets, hyperparameters, and performance.

---

## 3. Deployment & Serving

* **Hugging Face Inference API:** Host your fine-tuned model on the Hugging Face Hub for scalable inference.
* **Custom Inference Endpoints:** Deploy with `huggingface_hub` using `inference-endpoint` CLI for low-latency conversational serving.
* **Gradio Apps:** Extend your existing web UI with advanced features (file upload, interactive tutorials).

---

## 4. Integration with External Tools

* **LangChain & RAG:** Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline by connecting to vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) via `langchain-hf`.
* **Chatbots & Agents:** Use `transformers` pipelines to create multi-turn conversational agents with memory and tool use (web search, calculators).
* **Audio & Speech:** Integrate `speech-to-text` (Whisper) and `text-to-speech` (TTS) for multimodal tutor capabilities.

---

## 5. Advanced Techniques

* **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** Implement reward models and fine-tune with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using the `trl` library.
* **Quantization & Compression:** Experiment with 8-bit and 4-bit quantization (`bitsandbytes`, `quantization` toolkit) to optimize inference cost.
* **Model Distillation:** Distill Mistral 7B into smaller student models for deployment on edge devices.

---

## 6. Collaboration & Sharing

* **Hugging Face Hub:** Publish your fine-tuned models, datasets, and demos publicly or privately for feedback and collaboration.
* **Spaces:** Create a Hugging Face Space with Gradio or Streamlit to showcase your tutor demo online.
* **Community Engagement:** Contribute to Hugging Face forums, share tutorials, and open-source your code to support others.

---

## 7. Future Explorations

* **Multilingual Support:** Fine-tune on multilingual datasets for broader language coverage.
* **Knowledge Integration:** Connect to external knowledge bases (Wikidata, Wikipedia) for real-time factual updates.
* **Personalization:** Implement user profiles and adapt responses to individual learning styles using user embeddings.
